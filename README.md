# ZKNotes

Zknotes is a software fullstack of notes where anyone can create an account for free and create, edit and delete their notes. It is also possible to edit your username, change the password and completely delete it along with all your notes. The front-end was developed with React.JS and the back-end with Node.JS, using MongoDB as a database.
